        After changing into our caving gear, Bloomington Indiana Grotto memebers
        gather at the entrance to Dog Hill Cave. Everyone needs knee pads, a
        helmet, headlamp, and a waterproof backpack to store webbing and extra
        lights/batteries. The landowners are very kind to let us explore their
        private cave!

        One of my favorite caving activities is exploring side passages that are
        very small. Here two of my cave buddies are seen crawling through a
        passage that leads to nowhere. However, we still enjoy the physical
        challenge and end up finding interesting fossils.

        There are many large rimstone dams in this cave system. Here I climb up
        one of the larger ones. The neat thing about rimstone is that the
        surface of the formation has a lot of grip. This is very helpful when
        climbing and prevents slipping.

        My favorite features of a cave are those that are created by flowing
        water. Here the side walls are very smooth, yet jagged on the edges. We
        are deeper in the cave now and the water is becoming very clear and
        beautiful!

        This is one of the largest rooms in Dog Hill and it also contains some
        of the most impressive formations in the whole cave system. This is a
        good place to stop for pictures and possibly a little snack. We stopped
        to wait for the rest of the group to catch up.

        Here is a very beautiful formation that has formed over the entrance to
        the next passage. To gain access to the next room we needed to crawl
        under the formation and though the water. It was not a very hard crawl
        but it was fun!

        This is an example of an extremely tight crawling passage that goes over
        the top of the bathtub. Only very small cavers can fit through the
        passage. Larger cavers must access the next room via the bathtub.

        This is one fo the "bathtubs" found in Dog Hill. A "bathtub" refers to a
        small flooded crawling passage with only a few inches of breathing room.
        Ropes are installed to help guide you through the passage since it is
        very difficult to see the end of a bathtub.

        Here my cave buddy Mark completes his first "Bathtub". We take turn
        going one by one so that we do not create wakes in the passage. Creating
        wakes minimizes airspace even more. We all end up with wet ears due to
        what cavers refer to as "ear dips" or turning your head to the side to
        breath and submerging half of your head.

        This is the rope climb that leads to the Dog Hill-Donnehue connection
        point. We did not attempt the climb this trip as the group was too big
        and inexperienced. My next trip I will enter from Donnehue and decend
        into Dog Hill via rigging. But for now we return the way we came in!
