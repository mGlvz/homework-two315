        This site is dedicated to the documentation of the Dog Hill-Donnehue
        Cave System in Lawrence County, IN. This cave system had three
        entrances: Dog Hill, Donnehue Springs, and the Culvert entrance.
        However, to attempt a through trip (in at donnehue and exit at doghill)
        is extremely dangerous and should only be attempted by experiences
        cavers who know how to rig webbing for the 30 foot climb at the
        connection point. The through trip takes roughly 10 hours! This trip was
        taken by the Bloomington Indiana Grotto and only covers half the system.
        Grottos are local chapters of the National Speleological Society.
