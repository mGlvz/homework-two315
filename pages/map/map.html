        For this trip we entered at Dog Hill (top right corner) and followed the
        cave system west. Along the way we passed through the wet crawl,
        boreholes, rimstone dams, flowstone climb, and two bathtubs. We stopped
        after the second bathtub (15 marker) and right before Berg's Squeeze
        which leads to Donnehue. That passage is only accessible via a 30ft rope
        climb. The red line shows the way from Donnehue to the Culvert.
